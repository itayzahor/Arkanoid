# About
The game is constracted with 3 levels.

The first one - Wide and easy.

The game is built in this order but you can also run the game with arguments and run the levels you type.

for example: if you enter "3 2"

it will run level 3 and then 2.

I encourage anyone that wants to create more levels, better backgrounds or even special affect.
